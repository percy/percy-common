# Creating a Release on GitHub

Finish the pre-started release opened by the script, or [create a new release](https://github.com/percy/percy-common/releases/new):

1. Enter "vX.X.X" as the tag version. It should auto complete to say "Existing Tag"
1. Enter "vX.X.X" as the release title
1. Write a brief description as to what is included in this release. Linking to specific PRs is great.
1. Click "Publish release"
